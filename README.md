This is my playground for trying out the modelina tooling in Rust, currently I don't like the structures generated by it,
but rather than digging my head into the typescript codebase I'm first going to write an AST manipulator script that fixes
some of the "mistakes" I have noticed in the generated code.

The next step will be writing a parser for the `schema` of an `asyncapi` spec to start generating some code how I prefer it,
This repo is currently just for me/fun.

# Goals
- [x] Fix modelina generated Rust structs with AST manipulation, as much spaghetti as is required, I intend to replace this code in the future.
- [ ] Write a partial asyncapi parser for the `schema` definition
- [ ] Using the parser generate Rust structures for deserialization/serialization
- [ ] Using the parser generate pydantic `python` models


# AsyncAPI Schema Parser
---
The initial idea was to parse & validate the schema at the same time through serde, however after experimenting a bit this seemed too restrictive. The project will deserialize first into some quite generic types and afterwards parse them to create instances of specific & expressive rust types.

Notes: 
- for `oneOf` fields inside of `ObjectSchema` the idea is to let users use the `discriminator` field of the wrapper object introduced for polymorphism as a specifier for the discriminant of a tagged rust enum.
- `allOf` will be just merging of properties, no inheritance.
