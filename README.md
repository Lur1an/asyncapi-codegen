Tjhis is my playground for trying out the modelina tooling in Rust, currently I don't like the structures generated by it,
but rather than digging my head into the typescript codebase I'm first going to write an AST manipulator script that fixes
some of the "mistakes" I have noticed in the generated code.

The next step will be writing a parser for the `schema` of an `asyncapi` spec to start generating some code how I like it,
this repo is currently just for me.

# Goals
- [ ] Fix modelina generated Rust structs with AST manipulation, as much spaghetti as is required, I intend to replace this code in the future.
- [ ] Write a partial asyncapi parser for the `schema` definition
- [ ] Using the parser generate Rust structures for deserialization/serialization
- [ ] Using the parser generate pydantic `python` models
